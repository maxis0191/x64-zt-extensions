# ZoneTool extensions

Private asset serializers, converters, independent readers and bounded extraction/build adapters for the pinned owner ZoneTool fork. No server gameplay or creator distribution policy.

This repository is private. It complements the public owner forks; it does not
publish private project code into them. See `product.json` for exact source
revisions and explicit file dependencies. Source extraction preserved authors
and commit messages; `migration/import.json` and `migration/commit-map.txt` map
the original server paths/commits to this history.

## Editing and source preparation

Edit the canonical tracked file here. Do not edit generated source workspaces.
The existing relative source layout is an explicit compatibility contract used
by hash-sensitive tools. Dependencies contribute only their listed files to a
fresh, bounded source package; they are not vendored into this repository.
The composition receipt records every owner, commit, Git blob and checkout-byte
hash. It does not qualify a native build or inherit an older runtime receipt.

Run the pinned IW7-Mod `ops/source_workspace.py` with `--project`, exact
`--revision`, one `--source PRODUCT=CHECKOUT` per dependency, and a fresh `--output`.
Each source checkout must match the manifest revision and have clean tracked
files. Paths with spaces are supported. Missing, different, dirty, redirected,
oversized, binary and overlapping sources are refused before output creation.
Then run `checks.ps1 -Workspace <output>` from this canonical checkout.

The command does not install a game, copy retail assets, build native code,
launch a process fixture, deploy, publish, or change Main. Build/run entrypoints
inside the package retain their own input, identity, resource and authorization
gates. Feature experiments remain paused until the owner's explicit GO.

## Evidence and rollback

Historical documents and pinned plans retain their original bytes and claims.
Use the recorded original checkout/commit for a frozen experiment. A moved or
rebuilt source needs a new plan and qualification. Failed results remain failed.
To roll back an integration, restore its earlier dependency revision in a new
reviewed commit, generate a fresh source package, and rerun the relevant tests.
This never restores or deploys game data, banks or binaries automatically.

## Licensing

Preserve upstream notices and per-file provenance. No blanket license is granted
to all private adaptations by this extraction. Public distribution requires its
own license/privacy review and owner decision. Commercial game assets, dumps,
installed SDKs, PDBs, executables, credentials and player data are excluded.

## Reproduce the source checks

Prerequisites: Git, authenticated GitHub CLI with read access to this private
repository, PowerShell 7.4+, Python 3.12 and Node.js 22. Native source checks also
use Java 21; pure native compilation requires the existing VS2022 C++ toolchain.
Asset image tests use the hash-pinned Pillow requirement in ops/doom-textures.

```powershell
./bootstrap.ps1 -Output "$PWD/runtime/source inputs"
./checks.ps1 -Workspace "$PWD/runtime/source inputs"
```

Bootstrap downloads only the immutable source dependency archive named in
`dependency-package.json` from this repository's private release. Its SHA-256,
length, members, owners and commits are checked. It needs no cross-repository
CI secret. Offline use: supply `-DependencyArchive <downloaded dependencies.zip>`.
The archive contains selected text sources, never tools, game data or binaries.
A missing archive fails clearly; no fallback version is selected.

Run an authorized operation from the generated package, or use
`bootstrap.ps1 -Entry ops/<entry>.ps1 -Arguments @(...)`. Canonical repositories
are editing locations; operations requiring another product must use prepared
inputs. Older commands in dated documents refer to their original frozen layout.
Do not reuse an old runtime receipt for a newly composed input.
